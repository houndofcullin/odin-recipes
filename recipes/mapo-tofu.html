    <h2>A Classic Sichuan Dish of Silken Tofu and Ground Beef Seasoned With Fermented Chili Bean Paste and Sichuan Peppercorns</h2>
    <p>
        Tofu is often misunderstood and regarded as little more than a "poor substitute for meat", which is extremely unfair, as it's a perfectly delicious ingredient in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
        A traditional Sichuan dish, mapo tofu is made with simmered medium-firm silken tofu flavored with fermented bean paste, beef, plenty of red-hot roasted chili oil, and a handful of Sichuan peppercorns. When done right, the dish comes out with a thick coating of hot chili oil covering its surface, keeping the contents underneath hot in both senses of the word. It's a great representation of málà, or hot and numbing flavor.
